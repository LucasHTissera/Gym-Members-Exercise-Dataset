# Gym-Members-Exercise-Dataset
Here's a dataset that I analized to show my Data Analysis skills.

I downloaded this database from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset/data

It contained the gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv file that is a fabricated dataset with the following columns:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Age: Age of the gym member.

Gender: Gender of the gym member (Male or Female).

Weight (kg): Member’s weight in kilograms.

Height (m): Member’s height in meters.

Max_BPM: Maximum heart rate (beats per minute) during workout sessions.

Avg_BPM: Average heart rate during workout sessions.

Resting_BPM: Heart rate at rest before workout.

Session_Duration (hours): Duration of each workout session in hours.

Calories_Burned: Total calories burned during each session.

WO_Type: Type of workout performed (e.g., Cardio, Strength, Yoga, HIIT).

Fat_Percentage: Body fat percentage of the member.

Water_Intake (liters): Daily water intake during workouts.

WO_Freq (days/week): Number of workout sessions per week.

Experience_Level: Level of experience, from beginner (1) to expert (3).

I'm going to describe my findings in Gym-Members-Exercise-Dataset.pdf
